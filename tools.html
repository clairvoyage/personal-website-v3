            <h3>ZOOM75 Mechanical Keyboard</h3>
            <p>I spent many hours choosing the specific keyboard and colors for my dream keyboard. 
                The keycaps are NicePBT Flower Shop, and the switches are BSUN Hutt.

            <h3>MacBook Air (M2, 2022)</h3>
            <p>I bough this laptop for college, and it's still going strong.
                Would you believe me if I said I chose this laptop specifically because it fit
                perfectly in my main backpack?

            <h2>Digital Art Tools</h2>
            <h3>XP-Pen Deco L</h3>
            <p>The cutest, pinkest drawing tablet you've ever seen. I usually pair this
                tablet with the drawing software Clip Studio Paint to create art on my 
                desktop.

            <h3>iPad Air Gen 5 and Apple Pencil</h3>
            <p>Though I had wanted an iPad for a very long time, I didn't buy one for 
                myself until very recently. It's been fantastic for drawing digitally 
                when I don't have access to my desktop. My software of choice on the iPad
                is Infinite Painter.
